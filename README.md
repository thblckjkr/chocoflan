# Chocoflan

Chocoflan server management with SSH on PHP. Baked with [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com)

> Chocoflan is a mexican cake, but, it is not really a Cake.

## Description

> This software, is a huge security breach on management. If you are on a controled environment,and you care a lot abot security, this is not you option. It is not a professional tool to do things. Just a way to do simple ssh things.

This software, it's intended to be used on a small enviroment where you have a small set of servers/computer that need to be easily supervised through SSH, without any aditional configuration on the devices to be supervised.

This program is a full rewrite of a small project that i had.
